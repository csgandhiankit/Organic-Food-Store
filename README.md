- Problem statement – New local food retailer chain, “OFS”, in the Bay Area counties (San Mateo, Santa Clara) wants to add delivery services as part of their business plan. First, use population density
information and map to determine strategically where to open their 1 store per county. 

- Second, make sure each store is optimally located so deliveries can be speedy.
we are responsible to develop the website where customer can purchase organic food (e.g. fruits, vegetables, and other grocery items into a virtual shopping cart. Pay for it online and have it delivery to
their home by a drone. Need to be able to track the delivery drone via Google map. Inventory, customer,transactions are processed and stored in RDBMS.

- Special note: We use Google Map for routing. With a drone, we don’t have to wait for traffic but we still need to use the same streets. Weight limit for drone delivery is 15 pounds so we need to track the weight of each food item in the database and shopping cart.
